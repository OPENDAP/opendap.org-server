= Support

Our goal is to support OPeNDAP to the best of our abilities and within our resources.
We think the best way to do this is to encourage community-based support.
If OPeNDAP users will try to follow the support guidelines below, we can all work to help each other.

== Support Guidelines

There are a few routes you can pursue to get your questions answered. The most effective
will likely be to start with already-written material, such as...

* link:http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/Making_Science_Data_Easier_to_Use_with_OPeNDAP[Making Science Data Easier to Use with OPeNDAP]
from the ESIP Federation.
* Proprietary OPeNDAP documentation:
    * link:https://opendap.github.io/documentation/UserGuideComprehensive.html[OPeNDAP User Guide]
    * link:https://opendap.github.io/documentation/QuickStart.html[OPeNDAP Quick Start Guide]
    * link:https://opendap.github.io/hyrax_guide/Master_Hyrax_Guide.html[Hyrax Data Server Documentation]
* The OPeNDAP email lists.

If none of the above links answer your question, you can drop us a direct line at support@opendap.org.
We'll assign your question to the appropriate OPeNDAP developer and respond as quickly as possible.
We attempt to respond to all emails within a few hours, either with an answer, a request for more information,
or a note letting you know that we're looking into the issue.

Keep in mind that your email (or the response) will be archived and searchable at the URL listed above.

=== Support Email Tips

When contacting us directly, consider how you can make your question intelligible
to an audience that is unfamiliar with your work:

* Include the OS that you are using and other applicable system information.
* Include your OPeNDAP component and version.

If you post a question and receive an answer in private emails,
please post a brief summary of the solution to opendap-tech@opendap.org (or support@opendap.org)
so that others can see the solution and so that the email archive contains the solution to your question.
