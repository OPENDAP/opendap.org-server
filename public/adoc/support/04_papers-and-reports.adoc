=== NASA Web Accessible API Cloud Study, OPeNDAP and THG

This study, conducted by OPeNDAP and The HDF Group, explored three candidate architectures for serving NASA Earth Science HDF5 data stored in S3 via Hyrax running on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

We found that simple approaches can yield optimal performance under many circumstances. Click here to download the PDF.
