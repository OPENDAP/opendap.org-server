The following is a collection of email going back to July 2013 regarding DAP4 and it's implementation. The items appear in roughly chronological order and the latter ones are primarily my (James) asking Dennis for clarification because I did not understand some item in the spec. In some cases, we made a decision about a feature at that point. The earlier items are more along the lines of hight level discussions and I thought they we important enough to keep in mind.

Dennis and I decided on this syntax for CEs that encompasses simple projections and array slicing, including when the arrays use shared dims. No grammar, just examples of what's allowed and explanations of what the examples mean.

CEs for DAP4

CE Syntax

....
<dataset name=t1>
     <dimension name=d size=20/>
     <byte name=b>
         <dim size=10/>
     </byte>
     <byte name=c>
          <dim name=d/>
    </byte>

    <structure name=s>
         <byte name=d>
             <dim name=d/>
         </byte>
         <byte name=e>
              <dim name=d/>
              <dim size=5/>
        </byte>
         <byte name=f>
             <dim name=d/>
         </byte>
    </structure>

</dataset>
....

Some CEs:

b ::
  Return just b
b;c ::
  Return both b and c
b[1:4] ::
  Slice b so that only elements 1 through 4 are returned. Since b does not use a shared dim the special properties of shared dims (sdims) don't matter. Although in this case it doesn't matter
c[] ::
  Return all of c but because a local slicing operation was performed, c is returned with dim 1 as an anonymous dim, not the sdim 'd'
/d=[2:5];c[]::
  Slice the sdim 'd' using [2:5]. For the variable c, apply that slice and return the result. In this case c will be shown with the sdmi 'd' but that sdim will be of size 4. Thus the _[]_ means two different things for an array with shared dims. Either return the whole dim as if a local slice was made or since that sdim was sliced (previously in the CE), use that slice. We use an explicit thing to cover the case where an array has both sdims and anonymous dims.

/d=[2:5];/s.d[]::
  Apply the sdim slice to the array 'd'. Since arrays and dims can have the same name, we use an _=_ to mean _this is a sdim and I'm slicing it_ in the CE. This is not a great example of that since the var and sdim have different FQNs, but it's possible for them to have the same FQN, hence the _=_
/d=[2:5];s.e[][]::
  Similarly, apply the slice to the first dim (using the sdim slice) and get all of the second dime
/d=[2:5];s.e[][1:3]::
  use the sdim slice and apply a slice to the second (anonymous) dim. really this is the same case as above, but with different values for the second dim's slice operator
/d=[2:5];s.e[1:4][1:3]::
  Return e with two anonymous dims; based on the original sizes. That is, even though the first dim in the DMR uses the sdim 'd', since we're using the local slicing operator, we take the 1:4 slice from the 20-element dimension. The only time a sdim slice applies is when an array is declared as using it in the DMR and _[]_ appears for that dim in the CE.

/d=[2:5];s\{d[],f[]} 

Slicing apples recursively

/d=[2:5];s.d[];s.f[]

Same result as the previous CE

/d=[2:5];s\{d[],e[][1]}

/d=[2:5];s[1:3]\{d,f}::
  This slicing op applies to 's' (which makes no sense with the example dataset; image it does make sense ;-)

CDMR: Will be a subset of the DMR. It may reference shared dims but will not create any dims

seq\{i,j,k} | j < 10 ::
  This filter, shown with a Sequence _seq_ (not int he example DMR) is applied to everything in the clause. CEs are made up of clauses separated by _;_ marks.

Bob Simons sent this: +
I liked your talk about OPeNDAP yesterday at ESIP. I especially liked your phrases "select by index", "select by coordinate", "select by value". They are useful phrases.

I understand and like "select by index". But since it is also useful to select by coordinate value, it would be great if OPeNDAP 4 would support the optional syntax "(value)" in projection constraints, where the value is converted to the nearest index. For example, variable[(startValue):stride:(stopValue)] would be converted by the server to variable[startIndex:stride:stopIndex] This would allow users to specify requests

For time variables (with units of "someTimeUnit since someTime"), it would be great if the startValue or stopValue could be expressed in whatever the dimensions units are (e.g., in "minutes since 1980-01-01") *or* as an ISO 8601:2004 "extended") time (e.g., 1985-12-31T23:59:59Z).

This also solves problems with datasets that just offer the latest e.g., 30 days of data. Currently, if a user requests the time values, finds the index for a current date, and requests the data with that time index, the dataset may have changed so that the requested index no longer has the value the user expects.

Is there any chance that the OPeNDAP 4 specification could include the () notation in projection constraints?

Thanks for considering this.

And we had a long thread about it: +
Dan- I think what might work is the use of functions inside of projections. e.g. velocity[f(start):stride:f(end)] where f converts something in say, time or lat or lon to an index. =Dennis

im pretty sure this is what bob is proposing. By my reading, Bob's request does *not* include coordinate values in the stride; he asks for coordinate-to-index translation only at the interval endpoints and expects only the *nearest* values there, so interpolation is never required. If we want to support coordinate values in the stride argument, some notion of "nearest" might be plausible (as Dennis hints), but I suspect Bob omitted this deliberately. It's not even clear to me that monotonicity is a requirement; without it, users could separate apples from oranges without knowing their indices.  ;-) I personally think Bob's notation could be accommodated directly in DAP4 without violating our KISS commitment *if we restrict it to 1-D maps*. Use with N-D maps strikes me as complicated, and I think it leads to questions of the sort Nathan raises, so I would not try to bite off that one (within DAP4). Also, I'm less inclined toward including Bob's time-translation request because it involves interpreting the "units" attribute. For me that smacks of extension along the lines Ethan suggests. Stated another way, I can see the ( ) to [ ] translation as truly domain independent, but notions of time seem less so. Finally, could someone remind me: are coordinate maps a formal data type in DAP4, or are they established via naming conventions? Thanks, Dave On 7/16/2013 9:31 AM, Dennis Heimbigner wrote:

Thinking about Nathan's last comment leads me to dissect this issue a bit more.

Suppose we have the following schema using time as in Bob's original request. The lat/lon issue is similar except in 2 dimensions.

dimensions: time=... variables:

....
float velocity(time);
float time(time);
....

If we want to get the time of velocity(i), then we can compute time(i).

The inverse of this is to ask for the velocity at time 1/1/13, for example.

If I understand Bob's suggestion, he is saying one should be able to ask for velocity(1/1/13) and get the velocity at that time. Or similarly, ask for the range of velocities(1/1/13:1hr:1/2/13).

The problem comes in figuring out to choose which integer indices of the time dimension are be included in the set given that it may be the case that none of the values 1/1/13,1/1/13+2hr,...1/2/13 are actually in the time(time) variable. This means we need to define an algorithm to decide which indices are in the set and which are out. Finding the initial starting index requires searching time(time) to find, say, the first i such that time(i) >= 1/1/13. For each additional point, we need to either search for another "closest" point or interpolate between two adjacent velocity values based on some pair of covering points in the time(time) variable.

As Nathan points out, we can approximate the above by allowing domain based query. So we might say \{velocity(x,y)|time(x) >= 1/1/13 && time(x) <= 1/2/13} This has at least the advantage of being well defined and domain independent (more or less). When we met in Boulder, some of our discussions addressed this kind of query, but no resolution. It is fair to say, however, that it is still on our agenda.

Isn't it reasonable to factor out the lat/long coordinate issue? Can we not consider the two cases: a) Subsetting range values of array or Grid by value - if a particular value that exists in the Array/Grid fulfills the selection constraint then it is included in the response.

for 'grids' at some point it becomes a similar problem to constraining any array by value, that is what are the potential changes to the response type, if any, (.e.g., sparse array, mask, ...).

What is actually returned in both cases is the thing I think we would have to work out (a sparse array? a mask?)

I don't see how interpolation/search comes into it. So maybe Dennis you could elaborate on your concerns - I'm not following you.

the dependent variable based on 'selection by value' on the independent, or coordinate, variables using only the values in the coordinate variables themselves, that is, (.e.g., not supporting iso8601 time-values in the constraints and expecting conversion to seconds-since-1970). Then minimally there's the issue at the boundaries for any particular extent, or when discrete values are requested when the domain variable (in OGC parlance) is a coverage and not a point. So, regardless of geo or any specific domain there will be some extent of interpolation and/or search, and how that is communicated in the response. Also, in DAP-4 we're extending grid map-vectors to be n-dimensional, though typically size 1 or 2 is my guess, so the resulting shape for constrained variables will become quite important to the end-user client.

Remember that what was being proposed is to map from the specification of a geo lat/long range to a set of integer indices. The inverse is not a problem (IMO). Going from lat/long to indices requires, I think, algorithms to deal with interpolation and search. I do not think, personally, that there is likely to be any agreement about which algorithms to use.

I think it's not a coordinates question but a select/subset by value question. If we limit our view of the problem to just subsetting arrays, Grids, and Sequences then I think if we solve the resulting data model issues (sparse arrays? masks? etc.) then we might have something really useful. And I don't think it adds a huge burden of thought or work. Unless of course I am mistaken and the possible result space turns out to be awful to represent.

Im not so sure, it might be very low hanging fruit. Note that it doesnt require georeferencing or feature types, just coordinates (maps). On the grid data type, i think all the semantics are already there. OTOH, it would require some clarifications.

I agree with Dennis on this one.

While Bob's proposal is very simple and elegant in its request encoding, it assumes things outside of the core DAP4 data model. So, to my mind it doesn't belong in the core specification.

It might make a good extension. But it would need to be fleshed out. It would need a few extensions to the DMR. For example, a way to indicate when it can be used (which datasets, which arrays, which dimensions). And, as Dennis mentions, the same for the interpolation algorithm.

For what its worth, my philosphy here is that DAP4 is intended to be the lowest level representation for data. Any additional semantics such as geographical coordinates and more generally feature types should be implemented on top of DAP4. The relatively simple semantics of DAP4 should not be made more complicated by embedding feature types. For example, embedding geographical coordinates requires defining the interpolation algorithm as part of the standard. If some other algorithm is desired, then how is that to be supported?

I am not sure. My immediate reaction is to ask how the client will know what kind of constraint to write in the presence of an 'eval='; that is, what is the DMR against which the constraint is written? =Dennis

We should elaborate on what the different keys might mean. _eval_ would run a function(s) and produce a virtual dataset. The server would return the DMR, etc., for that

It occurs to me that we need to augment our proposed constraint expression grammars with a description of what kinds of DMRs will result from our proposed constraints.

That is, given a constraint and a DMR for the unconstrained dataset, describe the DMR that corresponds to the result of applying the constraint.

To that end, I have put up a new proposal based on describing rules for constructing the DMR that results from a constraint. http://docs.opendap.org/index.php/DAP4:_Alternate_Proposal_for_a_Constraint_Expression_Syntax

also: My recollection is that we decided to only allow filtering based on the outermost variables (i and j in this case) and filtering based on k would be illegal.

*nb*: This is a big deal for nested sequences because it you were to require that zero-length child sequences suppress the serialization of their parent sequence (as was the case with DAP2) the code to handle the sequence serialization becomes very complex.

Yes signed.

In the telecon we decided that the make number of elements was 2^61-1. We decided that the number of bytes for an array should never be more than 2^64-1 bytes (because the size needs to be signed because Java and Python don't grok unsigned ints) and because C code will need to malloc these and malloc won't take more than a 64-bit int.
