This document specifies the DAP4 Asynchronous HTTP Response extension. It defines the set of HTTP mechanisms used by DAP4 clients and servers when requesting or delivering asynchronous responses.

This extension provides DAP4 with a mechanism that allows servers to handle requests where the construction or computation of the response takes more time than a client may wish to wait.

== [#Overview:_Asynchronous_Service_Behavior_and_Responses .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#3# Overview: Asynchronous Service Behavior and Responses#

Asynchronous responses are responses that will take the server some time to build. When a client is told that a response 'is asynchronous,' it must know to come back at a later time to retrieve the response. The concept is a very simple one, and the existing network infrastructure is very good at supporting these kinds of interactions. A major factor in the success of the proposed solution will be the level of uniform support for the design. Secondly, as is often the case, the details will be more complex than the underlying concept. In particular, the request mechanism must be extended so that synchronous (regular) requests are not affected by the addition of asynchronous requests and, at the same time, clients do not inadvertently make asynchronous requests. another detail is that the (asynchronous) responses are _ephemeral_ because they typically only persist for a period of time and then be purged.

A typical 'workflow' for an asynchronous request is:

. A client makes a data request that indicates that it will accept either an asynchronous or synchronous response. Optionally, the client can place a time constraint on the response, indicating that if the response will not be ready in a given period of time, it does not want the response.
. The server returns an initial response (without delay) that indicates the request has indeed resulted in an asynchronous response and provides the client with a URL and time estimate.
. The client reads the time estimate and waits...
. The client dereferences the URL and gets the response.

Examples::
  A DAP4 server that is retrieving data content from a near-line tape storage subsystem might take several minutes to access a particular data holding.
  +
  A DAP4 server that is providing access to data held in an Amazon Web Services Glacier Vault will have to wait ~4 hours before it can retrieve a particular holding.

In these circumstances the server may return the DAP4 Asynchronous Response.

The remainder of this section will expand on this basic workflow using examples that focus on the HTTP protocol but that also allow for the use of other transport protocols.

== [#Client_willingness_to_accept_asynchronous_responses .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#4# Client willingness to accept asynchronous responses#

A client can indicate willingness to accept asynchronous responses in one of two ways:

* By including the link:#Accept_DAP_Asynchronous_Response[X-DAP-Async-Accept] HTTP header.
* By adding the link:#DAP4_Constraint_Expression_extension_for_Async[async] keyword to the DAP constraint expression.

If the client indicates that it must have access to the asynchronous response content within a certain time (utilizing either the link:#Accept_DAP_Asynchronous_Response[X-DAP-Async-Accept] HTTP header and/or the link:#DAP4_Constraint_Expression_extension_for_Async[async] keyword in the constraint expression) and the response will not be available in that time frame, the server MUST reject the request and return an HTTP status of link:#412_Precondition_Failed[412] and the link:#DAP_Asynchronous_Request_Rejected[DAP Asynchronous Request Rejected] XML document.

If both the _X-DAP-Async-Accept_ HTTP header and the _async_ keyword are used, the keyword takes precedence.

Servers must reject requests that require an asynchronous response if the client has not indicated willingness to accept such a response. Rejection of such requests is indicated by all three of the following:

. link:#400_DAP_Asynchronous_Response_Required[HTTP status of 400]
. Inclusion of the link:#DAP_Asynchronous_Response_Required[X-DAP-Async-Required] HTTP response header
. The response body must contain the link:#DAP_Asynchronous_Response_Required[DAP Asynchronous Response Required] XML document.

This safety check (requiring clients to explicitly indicate their willingness to accept asynchronous responses) is required because otherwise very simple clients might inadvertently make requests that will result in an asynchronous responses, and these kinds of responses are likely to use disproportionately (relative to synchronous responses) more server resources. We want to make DAP4 so that simple clients work well and don't encounter unexpected 'hiccups.'

== [#Initial_processing_by_the_server .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#5# Initial processing by the server#

When a request is accepted by the server and it will result in an asynchronous response, the server MUST the server MUST return a 202 (Accepted) HTTP status code and the link:#DAP_Asynchronous_Request_Accepted[DAP Asynchronous Request Accepted] XML document. This document contains a URL to the pending result of the request.

Of course, this discussion is about the mechanism that enables a client to make a request and the server to provide _information about_ an asynchronous response to that request. It does not cover any of the nearly infinite ways a server might actually make the _content_ of that response. It is likely that servers will write the responses to files and the URL returned to the client will be used to retrieve that file, but there's no requirement that servers do that. The only requirements on server are that:

. The URL returned asserts, using the link:#DAP4_Constraint_Expression_extension_for_Async[constraint expression syntax for async] that the client accepts async responses.
. The URL returned can be dereferenced and that operation will return the response requested by the client.

== [#Response_retrieval_by_the_client .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#6# Response retrieval by the client#

When a client requests an asynchronous result that is ready, the server MUST return a 200 (OK) HTTP status code and the resulting data response. If the client attempts to access the asynchronous result prior to it's availability, the server SHOULD return an HTTP response status of link:#409_Conflict_-_DAP4_Response_Not_Ready[409 (DAP Response Not Ready)] along with the link:#DAP4_Asynchronous_Response_Not_.28Yet.29_Available[DAP Asynchronous Response Not Available] XML document. If the server does not return the 409 response status then it MUST return a 404 (Not Found) response along with whatever document it deems fit as the response body.

If the client attempts to access the asynchronous result after it is no longer available, the server SHOULD return an link:#410_Gone_-_DAP4_Response_No_Longer_Available[HTTP response status of 410 (Gone)] along with the link:#DAP4_Asynchronous_Response_Gone[DAP4 Asynchronous Response Gone] document. If the server does not return the 410 response status then the server MUST return a 404 (Not Found) response along with whatever document it deems fit as the response body.

In each case above where the server SHOULD return a specific error code, but may return a 404 code instead, the intent is for servers to provide the most appropriate use of HTTP/1.1's error codes while also providing servers with an 'out' when that is hard for them to do. For example, knowing that a response, which is essentially ephemeral, is gone would, in theory, require to server to keep a record of every URL ever issued for an asynchronous response and that is not practical. At the same time, it is easy to see that a client would really like to know that the response has not yet been finished (i.e., it has not waited long enough) or that it is gone (i.e., it waited too long).

== [#Detail:_Client_requests .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#7# Detail: Client requests#

=== [#DAP4_Constraint_Expression_extension_for_Async .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#7.1# DAP4 Constraint Expression extension for Async#

By adding a keyword/value pair to the DAP4 query string we can allow a client to encode it's willingness to accept an asynchronous response, along with the a maximum amount of time the client can wait before it can access the response.

dap4.async::
  A value of zero indicates the client is willing to unconditionally accept an asynchronous response. A positive integer value will be interpreted as the number of seconds that the client will wait for access to the response. If the value is negative the serve MUST return an error.

Examples::
  Client is willing to unconditionally accept an asynchronous response
  +
  `?dap4.async=0`

Client is willing to wait for 60 seconds for access to the asynchronous response

`?dap4.async=60`

=== [#X-DAP-Async-Accept .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#7.2# X-DAP-Async-Accept#

A client may indicate willingness to accept asynchronous responses by including the _X-DAP-Async-Accept_ HTTP header. Clients can make conditional requests for asynchronous responses by indicating the maximum time they are willing to wait by using the *X-DAP-Async-Accept* HTTP header with a value given in seconds. A value of zero indicates that the client is willing to accept whatever delay the server may encounter.

== [#Detail:_Server_responses .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#8# Detail: Server responses#

Several 'experimental' HTTP headers are used by this design. They convey information either in the request (like the _X-DAP-Async-Accept_ described above) or they encode information for a response. While only clients that intend to support asynchronous responses need to understand all of these, _every_ client SHOULD understand the _X-DAP-Async-Required_ header. Because we need to support clients like web browsers, knowledge of that header is not required, but DAP4-specific clients will provide the most information to users if they know to look for at least that response header.

=== [#HTTP_Response_Headers .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#8.1# HTTP Response Headers#

==== [#X-DAP-Async-Required .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#8.1.1# X-DAP-Async-Required#

The _X-DAP-Async-Required_ HTTP response header is included in the response if the request requires an asynchronous response and the client has not indicated willingness to accept such a response. Rejection of the request should also be indicated by the link:#400_DAP4_Asynchronous_Response_Required[400 DAP Asynchronous Response Required] HTTP response code.

==== [#X-DAP-Async-Accepted .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#8.1.2# X-DAP-Async-Accepted#

The _X-DAP-Async-Accepted_ HTTP response header is included in the response if the server has accepted an asynchronous request. Acceptance of the request should also be indicated by the link:#202_Accepted[202 Asynchronous Request Accepted] HTTP response code.

=== [#HTTP_Response_Codes .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#8.2# HTTP Response Codes#

HTTP provides a number of response codes beyond the simple 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found) and 500 (Internal Server Error). In this design we describe how those standard codes SHOULD be used by DAP4 servers. We don't enumerate all of the possible codes, instead opting for a description of those that most relevant.

==== [#202_Accepted .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#8.2.1# 202 Accepted#

A server indicates that a request has been accepted and will be handled asynchronously by returning a '202 Accepted' HTTP response code. The response body must contain a document in one of the asynchronous information media types listed link:#Media_Types[below]. A server MUST return this response, and only do so, when a client has indicated a willingness to process an asynchronous response and the response will actually be returned using the asynchronous mechanism.

==== [#400_DAP4_Asynchronous_Response_Required .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#8.2.2# 400 DAP4 Asynchronous Response Required#

The '400 DAP Asynchronous Response Required' HTTP response code is used to indicate that the DAP4 request has been rejected because an asynchronous response is required and the client did not indicate willingness to accept an asynchronous response.

The response code text is used to indicate the reason for the rejection. However, since the '400' HTTP response code is not specific to asynchronous DAP (the standard text for the '400' code is "Bad Request"), the _X-DAP-Async-Required_ HTTP response header is also included in the response (see link:#Accept_DAP_Asynchronous_Response[above]).

*Note* that a standard 400 HTTP response code is returned. In this way, a client that does not understand asynchronous DAP can fail gracefully. The response code text message has been changed to be more informative of the reason for the failure. For clients that are aware of asynchronous DAP, the "DAP-Async-Required" header is set to "true". The body of the response also returns some information the client can use to decide on how it will continue.

==== [#409_Conflict_-_DAP4_Response_Not_Ready .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#8.2.3# 409 Conflict - DAP4 Response Not Ready#

The '409 Conflict' HTTP response code MAY be returned by a server to indicate that the DA4P request has been rejected because a previous asynchronous request has not been completed and the result is not ready for access. If a server utilizes the '409 Conflict' HTTP response code it must also return a link:#DAP4_Asynchronous_Response_Not_.28Yet.29_Available[DAP4 Asynchronous Response Not Yet Available] document in the response body.

==== [#410_Gone_-_DAP4_Response_No_Longer_Available .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#8.2.4# 410 Gone - DAP4 Response No Longer Available#

The '410 Gone' HTTP response code MAY be used by a server to indicate that the result of an asynchronous request is no longer available. If a server utilizes the '410 Gone' HTTP response code it must also return a link:#DAP4_Asynchronous_Response_Gone[DAP4 Asynchronous Response Gone] document in the response body.

==== [#412_Precondition_Failed .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#8.2.5# 412 Precondition Failed#

The '412 Precondition Failed' HTTP response code is used to indicate that the DAP request has been rejected because it did not meet the *X-DAP-Async-Accept* condition (see link:#Accept_DAP_Asynchronous_Response_Conditionally_on_Estimated_Time_to_Completion[above]) that was specified in the request.

==== [#500_Internal_Error .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#8.2.6# 500 Internal Error#

The '500 Internal Error' HTTP response code is used to indicate that the DAP request has caused an error on the server. The request body and other headers must be compliant with the link:/index.php?title=DAP4_Web_Services_v3#DAP4_Error_Response[DAP4 Error Response] and link:/index.php?title=DAP4_Web_Services_v3#Status_Codes[Status Codes] sections of the link:/index.php?title=DAP4_Web_Services_v3[web services specification]. The request should not be repeated.

=== [#Asynchronous_Response_Documents .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#8.3# Asynchronous Response Documents#

The uses of these documents are:

* to inform clients that a request will result in an asynchronous response;
* to provide clients with the status of an an accepted asynchronous request; and
* to inform clients that a request for and asynchronous response has been rejected.

These response documents are the payloads to various responses, including errors. By using the HTTP 400-series error response codes, the design ensures that generic web clients will understand that their request was in error (even if they don't really understand why). The text provided with the response code will be sufficient that person could understand the gist of the problem, if not more. The response documents described here, along with the _X-DAP_ describe above, are a way of providing additional information to a savvy client so that it can take full advantage of the synchronous response system.

These documents are XML that follows the DAP Asynchronous XML schema and are declared in the namespace *http://opendap.org/ns/dap/asynchronous*.

==== [#DAP4_Asynchronous_Response_Required .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#8.3.1# DAP4 Asynchronous Response Required#

This document informs clients that a request will result in an asynchronous response, and that the client has not yet indicated it's willingness to accept an asynchronous response. It might seem superfluous to include a document that clearly only a client knowledgable about the asynchronous response features could parse, but many such clients may not, as a matter of course, indicate they will accept these responses. For example, a user-configurable parameter might be turn off support for the feature. The _expectedDelay_ and _responseLifetime_ elements convey information about conditions the clients can expect if it submits an asynchronous request for the response. As noted below, these are estimates made by the server since a number of things that the server cannot predict can affect them in the interleaving time between the client's requests. Additionally, a server MAY return values of zero for either of the values, indicating that it cannot make an accurate estimate.

....
<AsynchronousResponse status="required">
  <expectedDelay seconds="600" />
  <responseLifetime seconds="3600"/>
</AsynchronousResponse>
....

This response MUST be associated with the 400 HTTP response code and the _X-DAP-Async-Required_ response header.

==== [#DAP4_Asynchronous_Request_Accepted .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#8.3.2# DAP4 Asynchronous Request Accepted#

This response informs clients that a request resulting in an asynchronous response has been accepted, along with operational information about retrieving the asynchronous response result. Note that the _expectedDelay_ and _responseLifetime_ elements are an estimate by the server. A server SHOULD ensure that the response will remain available for the time period given by _expectedDelay_ and _responseLifetime_. We say _SHOULD_ and not _MUST_ because we cannot predict all possible operational situations where these kinds of responses might be used. For example, a server might be providing access for several types of users who might have different access priorities, especially to limited resources like those typically involved with asynchronous access, and thus some responses might be further delayed, or removed early, to enable processing of requests from users with higher priority. It should be kept in mind, however, that the usefulness of the asynchronous responses will depend, in part, on servers providing a facility on which clients can depend.

While the _expectedDelay_ and _responseLifetime_ elements are required, a server MAY set their _seconds_ attribute to _0_ to indicate that it cannot provide a reliable value. In this case, clients SHOULD poll every 300 seconds and servers SHOULD expect this behavior. This is the default TCP user timeout period (see http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5482).

....
<AsynchronousResponse status="accepted">
  <expectedDelay seconds="600" />
  <responseLifetime seconds="3600"/>
  <link href="http://server.org/async/path/result" />
</AsynchronousResponse>
....

This response document MUST be associated with the 202 HTTP status code and the _X-DAP-Async-Accepted_ response header.

==== [#DAP4_Asynchronous_Response_Not_(Yet)_Available]##[#DAP4_Asynchronous_Response_Not_.28Yet.29_Available .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#8.3.3# DAP4 Asynchronous Response Not (Yet) Available#

This document informs clients that a while a previous request for an asynchronous response has been accepted, the result is not available.

....
<AsynchronousResponse status="pending"/>
....

This response document MUST be associated with the link:#409_Conflict_-_DAP4_Response_Not_Ready[409 HTTP response code].

Servers SHOULD return this response document and it's associated HTTP status of 409, but servers MAY return any document in the response body along with either a a 404 (Not Found) or a 400 (Bad Request) HTTP status.

==== [#DAP4_Asynchronous_Response_Gone .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#8.3.4# DAP4 Asynchronous Response Gone#

This document informs clients that a while a previous request for an asynchronous response has been accepted, the result is _no longer_ available.

....
<AsynchronousResponse status="gone"/>
....

This response document MUST be associated with the link:#410_Gone_-_DAP4_Response_No_Longer_Available[410 HTTP status code].

Servers SHOULD return this response document and it's associated HTTP status of 410, but servers MAY return any document in the response body along with either a a 404 (Not Found) or a 400 (Bad Request) HTTP status.

==== [#DAP4_Asynchronous_Request_Rejected .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#8.3.5# DAP4 Asynchronous Request Rejected#

This document informs clients that a request for an asynchronous response has been rejected, even though the client said it is willing to process an asynchronous response. There are at least as many reasons a server might reject the request for an asynchronous response as there are systems that might return such responses. However, this design provides suggested response codes for cases that seem likely so that clients can make educated decisions about the reason for the rejection. The reason codes supported are:

time::
  The client indicated that it was only willing to wait _X_ seconds and the server thought it would take more time to build the result.
unavailable::
  A needed resource is not available. This might indicate that hardware, like a robot tape system, cannot be currently accessed.
privileges::
  The client is not allowed to make the request.
other::
  Self evident...

In addition to the reason codes, this response will contain a text description of the reason for rejection.

Servers SHOULD make every effort to use the correct reason codes and provide cogent descriptions.

....
<AsynchronousResponse status="rejected">
    <reason code="time"/>
    <description>Acceptable access delay was less than estimated delay.</description>
</AsynchronousResponse>
....

This response document MUST associated with the 412 HTTP status code.

Servers SHOULD return this response document along with an HTTP status of 412, but servers MAY return any document in the response body along with an HTTP status of 404 (Not Found) or of 400 (Bad Request) in its place.

==== [#DAP4_Error .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#8.3.6# DAP4 Error#

If the server encounters an error it must MUST (MAY?) return an HTTP status of 500 (Internal Error) along with a request body and other headers compliant with the link:/index.php?title=DAP4_Web_Services_v3#DAP4_Error_Response[DAP4 Error Response] and link:/index.php?title=DAP4_Web_Services_v3#Status_Codes[Status Codes] sections of the link:/index.php?title=DAP4_Web_Services_v3[web services specification]. The request should not be repeated.

*NB*: This example originally included an _Accept_ header with the value of _multipart/mixed_. However, that is not a good example. The HTTP/1.1 specification says that when a specific media type is indicated as the only one acceptable, a server must return a 406 response code if it cannot return that media type. The meaning of _Accept: */*_ is the same as not including the header, so I have removed the header from these examples. We need to be heads up in the ways that we suggest that header should be used by clients
