As we mentioned above, OPeNDAP is a not-for-profit corporation (a 501(c)(3), to be precise),
so we do contribute our work freely to the public. That being said, the work does
consume our fully-dedicated time and attention.

We are supported in our efforts by a number of governmental and private institutions.
This support takes the form of grants, contracts, products and services, and donations.
Please find here a list of our supporters, to whom we owe our ability to continue to provide
software and services to the members of our user community.
