= Hyrax

Hyrax is our in-house implementation of OPeNDAP's Data Access Protocol (DAP). It comprises
a web api and a compute engine, both of which work together to serve virtually any 
link:/source-data-formats[data structure or source]
in a variety of formats, including DAP, DAP4, JSON, and link:/hyrax-about#data-retrieval-formats[many more].

// OPeDAP engages in research work. We're available to partner with universities and other
// entities:
//   support services
//   conducting research
//   peer reviewed publications,
//   co-authors on proposals
//   federally funded

// "We can be co-pis on your proposal" more difficult than SPIR, small business innovative.
// OPeNDAP benefits, because it provides a way for us to explore technologies that are risky.
// As a software company, they have to produce something that's a reliable, but that's
// not where you get to test the really big ideas. For example, explored replacing latitude and longitude.
// That's not for operational support, the contracts are.

// NASA wants people to be able to use OPeNDAP to access data, so OPeNDAP works with them 
// closely to make sure that goal can be realized. An operational piece of software is
// very complicated; make sure it works all the time by maybe thousands of people at the same time.

// Hyrax is not the only system that supports various DAPs. Other systems include...

// * *THREDDS Data Server (TDS)*: TDS is designed and mainted by Unidata. It supports a variety
// of remote data access protocols and is arranged around the way that Java manages data.
// * *ERDDAP*: ERDDAP is designed and maintained by NOAA. Like the others on this list,
// it supports many remote data access protocols and is tailored to the way that NOAA
// organizes its oceanographic data.
// * *Pydap*: Pydap, developed by members of the Python community, is a pure Python implementation
// of OPeNDAP's data access protocol.
