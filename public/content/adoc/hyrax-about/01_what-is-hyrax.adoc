= Hyrax

Hyrax is our in-house implementation of OPeNDAP's Data Access Protocol (DAP). It's a system that comprises two parts:
the OPeNDAP Lightweight Front-end Server (OLFS) implements a web API, and the Back-end Server (BES) is a compute engine.
The OLFS and the BES work together to serve data.
The OLFS receives requests via the web API and creates XML documents for the BES.
The BES ingests the XML file and works with different types of datastores to construct the correct response.
That response is then sent back to the OLFS.

// OPeDAP engages in research work. We're available to partner with universities and other
// entities:
//   support services
//   conducting research
//   peer reviewed publications,
//   co-authors on proposals
//   federally funded

// "We can be co-pis on your proposal" more difficult than SPIR, small business innovative.
// OPeNDAP benefits, because it provides a way for us to explore technologies that are risky.
// As a software company, they have to produce something that's a reliable, but that's
// not where you get to test the really big ideas. For example, explored replacing latitude and longitude.
// That's not for operational support, the contracts are.

// NASA wants people to be able to use OPeNDAP to access data, so OPeNDAP works with them 
// closely to make sure that goal can be realized. An operational piece of software is
// very complicated; make sure it works all the time by maybe thousands of people at the same time.

// Hyrax is not the only system that supports various DAPs. Other systems include...

// * *THREDDS Data Server (TDS)*: TDS is designed and mainted by Unidata. It supports a variety
// of remote data access protocols and is arranged around the way that Java manages data.
// * *ERDDAP*: ERDDAP is designed and maintained by NOAA. Like the others on this list,
// it supports many remote data access protocols and is tailored to the way that NOAA
// organizes its oceanographic data.
// * *Pydap*: Pydap, developed by members of the Python community, is a pure Python implementation
// of OPeNDAP's data access protocol.
