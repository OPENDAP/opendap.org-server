OPeNDAP's mission is to promote the use of online data. With that mission in mind,
we developed Hyrax both horizontally and vertically: horizontally, in that Hyrax can be easily
extended to support many data structures and sources, and vertically, in that it is highly integrated
with NASA, which has thousands of highly-structured datasets.

Additionally, if an organization needs to implement a new data structure or source within Hyrax,
OPeNDAP as a company provides consulting services. We can assign our developers
to the task and are willing to negotiate on time and materials, as well as fixed-price contracts.
