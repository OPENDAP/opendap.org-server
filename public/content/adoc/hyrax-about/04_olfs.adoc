= OPeNDAP Lightweight Front-end Server (OLFS)

The OLFS uses the Java servlet mechanism to hand off requests from a general web daemon to the BES. 
It looks at each request and formulates a query to a second server, the BES. 

While the BES takes care of the heavy lifting, the front-end does metadata work, such as support for web coverage service
and meta-data transformation.
