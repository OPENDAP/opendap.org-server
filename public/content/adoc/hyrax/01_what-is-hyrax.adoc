= What is Hyrax?

Hyrax is a system that comprises two parts: the OPeNDAP Lightweight Front-end Server, generally referred to by its acronym, OLFS,
and the Back-end Server, the BES. The OLFS and the BES work together to serve data;
the OLFS converts client requests to the language of the BES, and the BES serves the requested data in the requested format.

// OLFS undersatnds the way requests are structured
// Takes request that the client issues and converts it to the language of the back-end server.
// Sometimes has to query the BES to figure out what to do

// Has two parts, because there was a desire to disconnect front end from back-end, a security layer. OLFS is point of contact for entire world.
// They can be run on seperate system--physically or virtually. Back-end is the only thing that can touch data.
// BES takes care of the heavy lifting, except...
//   front-end does metadata work, such as support for web coverage service
//   meta-data transformation
//   Front end says to back-end tell me everything you know about this
//   Distributed as a web archive file, runs inside of a Tomcat

// XXL transform

// Front-End application sits in front of the BES



// Hyrax is a data server that forwards requests from a general web daemon to DAP format-specific software.
// This provides higher performance for small requests.


// Hyrax uses the Java servlet mechanism to hand off requests from a general web daemon to DAP format-specific software. 
// The servlet front end, which we call the OPeNDAP Lightweight Front end Server (OLFS) looks at each request and formulates a query to a second server (which may or may not on the same machine as the OLFS) called the Back End Server (BES).

// The BES is the high-performance server software from HAO. It reads data from the data stores and returns DAP-compliant responses to the OLFS. In turn, the OLFS may pass these response back to the requestor with little or no modification, or it may use them to build more complex responses. The nature of the Inter Process Communication (IPC) between the OLFS and BES is such that they should both be on the same machine or able to communicate over a very high-bandwidth channel.

// Hyrax is one example of a number of data servers that implement OPeNDAPâ€™s Data Access Protocol (DAP).

// The OLFS and the BES will run and serve test data immediately after a default installation. Additional configuration is required for them to serve site specific data.
