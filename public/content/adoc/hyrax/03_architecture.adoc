= Architecture

While it may seem like an odd design decision to split Hyrax into two pieces of software,
we had a few reasons for doing so. Firstly, the OLFS and the BES have fundamentally different functions:
the BES is esentially an intelligent data warehouse that injests DAP requests and returns data,
whereas the OLFS tackles the highly-complex task of converting human-readable HTTP requests to
non-human-readable DAP requests.

  "id": "hyrax-architecture",
  "filename": "hyrax-architecture.html",
  "parsedFile": ""
}}

Our second consideration has to do with security. The OLFS is the point of contact for the entire world,
meaning that, while very secure in its own right, it is exposed to security threats. The BES, on the other hand,
is only accessible via the OLFS. If the OLFS is breached, intruders will be able to access data,
but they will only be able to inflict minimal damage.
