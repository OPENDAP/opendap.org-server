= Version Control

We have moved most of our active projects to [GitHub](https://github.com/opendap).
You can clone the libdap, bes, and other projects' repositories from github.com/opendap.
We respond to problem tickets submitted on the site,
but our primary issue tracking system is Jira, which has open access for readers.

== GitHub Links

There are many projects in our GitHub repository, here are some:

== Subversion (SVN)

A way to get older source code is to use anonymous access to our read-only SVN repository.
In 2015 we moved to GitHub for most of our active projects and switch the SVN repository
to read-only access. To access older code from SVN, you can...

* Visit the link:https://scm.opendap.org/svn/[svn repository].
This is a good way to read over source code if you have specific questions
about how a particular function has been implemented. 
* You can use a variety of subversion clients to read from the repository.
Generally, you will want to check out source code from the repository's link:https://scm.opendap.org/svn/trunk/['trunk'].
There are many subversion clients available and many plugins for IDEs.
* If you want to perform active development work on the older code,
please move it to GitHub and/or let us know so we can move it.
