# OPeNDAP Server Data Encoding

The data of OPeNDAP server's response is encoded using the XDR standard (eXternal Data Representation),
and packed into the second part of the response document. For more information on XDR, see
[Internet RFC 1014](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1014.html).
For further details, see OPeNDAP Programmer's Guide Section A.1.3.
