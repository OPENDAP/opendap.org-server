# Data Accessibility

Available OPeNDAP servers are listed on our
["Available OPeNDAP Servers"](/software)
web page.

If your data is in a format for which an OPeNDAP server has already been written, simply
[download the appropriate server](/software)
and install it on your machine. (See the User's Guide for details on how to install a server.)

If your data is not in a format with an existing server, you have two options.

1. Describe your data using the FreeForm data description language.
Once you can describe your data with FreeForm, you can use the FreeForm server
to make your data available.

2. Write a new server for your data format. The difficulty of this task
would depend on the complexity of your data format.
For developing a server in C++, see the Programmer's Guide and the Programmer's Reference
and the tutorial Writing a Server for more information.
For developing a server in Java, see the OPeNDAP Java JavaDocs.
Please contact us at support@unidata.ucar.edu to discuss the options before you begin.
