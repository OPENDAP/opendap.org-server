# What is the OPeNDAP software?

OPeNDAP has developed a software framework that simplifies all aspects of scientific data networking, allowing simple access to remote data. Local data can be made accessible to remote locations regardless of local storage format by using
[servers](https://www.opendap.org/support/OPeNDAP-servers).
Existing, familiar data analysis and visualization applications can be transformed into
[clients](https://www.opendap.org/support/OPeNDAP-clients)
(i.e., applications able to access remote served data).

The OPeNDAP Data Access Protocol (DAP) is a protocol for requesting and transporting data across the web. DAP 2.0 uses HTTP to frame the requests and responses. For details on DAP, see
[Data Access Protocol (DAP), version 2](https://www.opendap.org/support/faq/general/'/pdf/ESE-RFC-004v1.1.pdf)
which is a technical description of the Data Access Protocol. This was submitted to NASA's Earth Science Data Systems Standards Process Group and has been accepted as a Recommended Standard (submitted on 8/8/2004, accepted 10/8/2007). The official NASA ESE/RFC distribution point for DAP2 may provide a more up to date version and also has additional documentation regarding NASA/ESE's adoption of DAP2 as a community standard.

OPeNDAP supports a community of users working together to use, improve, and extend the DAP protocol and software.
