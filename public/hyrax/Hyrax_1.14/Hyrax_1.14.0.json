In verbose mode, the log contains detailed information about all of the work done by the BES. For developers we have introduced a way to trace which lines in the log file come from which parts of the server.Along with the above, we have switched to ISO8601 date-time strings for the log; UTC is the default. You can switch to local time using BES.LogTimeLocal in the BES configuration file (bes.conf). The old date format is still in the code and can be accessed using a compile-time switch.HYRAX-548: Use the  copytruncate directive in besd.logrotate to remove brute-force stop/start of the server when logs are rotated."
