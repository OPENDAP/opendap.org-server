# Get Involved

There are lots of ways you can help out with OPeNDAP development. You don't have to delve into code or protocol details to help. Feedback and bug reports are just as important for maintaining and advancing the OPeNDAP project.

However you choose to get involved, the first step is to subscribe to one or more of the 
[OPeNDAP email lists](https://www.opendap.org/support/mailing-lists).

### Users

Users are the core of the OPeNDAP. You let us know how we are doing and whether OPeNDAP is making your life easier. So, please use the OPeNDAP and let us know what's working for you and what is not.

* Download binary releases from our [Software download](https://www.opendap.org/software) page.
* Read the appropriate [OPeNDAP documentation](https://www.opendap.org/support/user-documentation).
* Provide feedback
    * Post questions and problems to the [email lists](https://www.opendap.org/support/mailing-lists).
    * Get an account on the OPeNDAP [bug tracking system](http://scm.opendap.org/trac/) and start reporting bugs.
    * Provide documentation suggestions.

### Developers

If you want to dive into the OPeNDAP code, you can:

* Either [download released source code](https://www.opendap.org/software) or get current code from our 
[SVN repository](https://www.opendap.org/software)
* Take a look at our [ToDo list](https://www.opendap.org/support/OPeNDAP-Software-Wish-List).
* Discuss changes, bug fixes, and other issues on the [email lists](https://www.opendap.org/support/mailing-lists).
* Work on code changes and bug fixes.

If you are developing code that uses the OPeNDAP protocol, we want to hear from you as well. Take a look at the 
[appropriate OPeNDAP documentation](https://www.opendap.org/support/user-documentation)
 and discuss it on the OPeNDAP [email lists](https://www.opendap.org/support/mailing-lists).

### Testing

* The source code comes with unit tests.
* If your are developing OPeNDAP servers, you might want to take a look at our test clients (C++ geturl, Java getURL, etc).
* If your are developing OPeNDAP clients, you might want to try our test server. The DODS Test Server (DTS) comes as part of the 
[Java code](https://www.opendap.org/software). We are also developing a suite of test servers (and datasets) for each version of the servers (including the current development branch). For more information on the test servers, email the opendap-tech list (you must be [subscribed](https://www.opendap.org/support/mailing-lists) first.
