# Software Archive

The HTTP archive holds just about every piece of software we have ever released.
Each release is held in a separate directory. Beta and final versions for each release
are within those directories. Below are shortcuts to specific parts of the archive
for people that want all of the source code without navigating through the pages specific
to each of the clients, servers, et cetera.
