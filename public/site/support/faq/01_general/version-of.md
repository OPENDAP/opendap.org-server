# What is the version of ... ?

A few possibilities:

* Run `ident` on a particular program. This will give you the `RCS $Id $` information
for the pieces of software that make up that program.
* For checking the version of a server, see
*Find the Version of the Server You're Communicating With* above.
* In Matlab or IDL run loaddods with the `-V` option.
