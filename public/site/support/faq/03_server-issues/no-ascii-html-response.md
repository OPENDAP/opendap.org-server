# Server Not Returning ASCII or HTML Responses

The ASCII and HTML responses are generated by accessing the server
using the URL (a future version of the server may use a different design;
this is true for version 3.4 and may be true for some later versions).
If you are serving data behind a firewall which uses NAT for address traslation,
the DNS lookup for the host name can fail.

Greg Miller from the USGS tracked down this problem and came up with a solution:

> I am behind a firewall that uses NAT translation, so if it was relying on DNS to find the address, it would fail. I checked my host file and discovered that Red Hat maps the server name into the loopback address and not the IP address of the ethernet interface. I corrected the host file, and everything works fine.
