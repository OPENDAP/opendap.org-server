# Reporting the Monthly Usage Statistics

You are under no obligation to report your OPeNDAP server usage statistics
to the OPeNDAP project. However, if you are willing to share this information,
it will help us direct future software development efforts more effectively.

For the OPeNDAP C++ servers, you can enable the sharing of this information
when you install your servers with the installServers script.
When the install script asks about gathering access statistics,
answer yes (`y`) and provide the additional information requested.
Your servers usage statistics will only be accessible by the local host
(your machine) and the official OPeNDAP machine.
