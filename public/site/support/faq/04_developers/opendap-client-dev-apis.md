# APIs Available For Developing OPeNDAP Clients

There are several APIs available for developing OPeNDAP clients:

* The OPeNDAP C++ implementations DAP API/library can be used to develop
OPeNDAP clients.
* The OPeNDAP Java implementations DAP API can be used to develop OPeNDAP clients.
* The OPeNDAP C++ implementations netCDF client library is an OPeNDAP enabled version of the netCDF interface.
* The Unidata netCDF Java library is OPeNDAP enabled "out of the box"
and includes OPeNDAP specific extensions for dealing with OPeNDAP data types
that don't fit in the netCDF data model.
