# SVN - Subclipse on Mac OS/X Not Working

On the Mac (OS/X), to get the Eclipse subversion plugin to work,
choose the command line interface mode, not the default based on javahl (JNI).
You'll need the subversion client installed for this to work.
Go to *Eclipse* > *Preferences* > *Team* > *SVN*.
