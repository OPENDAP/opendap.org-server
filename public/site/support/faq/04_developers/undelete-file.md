# SVN - Undelete Files

If you delete a file using `svn rm`, then use the copy command to restore it.

Note that after using `svn rm`, you need to use `svn ci` to commit that change.
Until then, the file is in limbo and things like `svn up` and `svn copy...`
have no affect. So first, complete the deletion and then use copy as follows:

    [jimg@zoey libdap]$ svn rm NEWS
    D         NEWS

    [jimg@zoey libdap]$ svn ci NEWS
    Deleting       NEWS

    [jimg@zoey libdap]$ svn copy -r 11906 https://scm.opendap.org/svn/trunk/libdap/NEWS NEWS
    A         NEWS

    [jimg@zoey libdap]$ svn ci NEWS
    Adding         NEWS
 
    Committed revision 11934.
