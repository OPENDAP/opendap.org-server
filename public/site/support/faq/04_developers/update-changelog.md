# Updating ChangeLogs Efficiently

First, ensure that all your commit logs contain the names of the
files being committed, then use the `update_cl.sh` described above.

You might want to use Emacs to wrap the lines, but aside from that,
the script will take only seconds to make a very useful ChangeLog file,
as long as you have included the names of the files in your commit logs.
