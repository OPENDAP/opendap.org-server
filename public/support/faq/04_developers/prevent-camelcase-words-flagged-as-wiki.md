# SVN - CamelCase Words Flagged as Wiki Pages

When entering a message string when checking code into Subversion,
entering text on a wiki page or anywhere else where WikiFormatting
is allowed. UpperCamelCase words are automatically flagged as wiki pages.
Frequently, this is not the intent. This feature be turned off by
prepending `!!` to the UpperCamelCase words.
