== Additional Features

In addition to the features we've outline above, we'd like to draw your attention to a few more
things that Hyrax has to offer:

[cols="0,1"]
|===
| Adding and Modifying Dataset Content
| Datasets can be modified by the server without having to actually change the underlying files. These views are independently accessible from the original data. Both dataset metadata and data values can be added or changed.

| Dataset Aggregation
| Collections of related data resources can be collected into a single dataset using the aggregation features. Typically these are formed for geographic tiles, time series, etc.

| geogrid
| Subset applicable DAP Grids using latitude and longitude values.

| grid
| Subset any DAP Grid object using the values of its map vectors.

| w10n
| Hyrax comes with a complete w10n service stack. W10n navigation is supported through the default catalog where all datasets and "structure" variables appear as graph nodes. Data can be acquired for atomic types or arrays of atomic types in a number of formats.

| Gateway
| Hyrax supports a gateway feature that allows it to provide DAP (and other Hyrax) services for remotely held datasets that are stored in any of Hyrax's source data formats.

| RDF
| Hyrax provides RDF descriptions of its data holdings. These can enable semantic web tools to operate upon the metadata content held in the server.

| JSON
| Both metadata and data are now available in a JSON encoding.

| WMS Services
| Hyrax now supports WMS services via integration with ncWMS.

| `linear_scale`
| Apply a linear equation to the data returned, including automatic use of CF attributes. The `version` function provides a list of the server-side processing functions available.

| Extensible/Configurable Web Interface
| The web interface for both Hyrax and the administrator's interface can be customized using CSS and XSL. You can add your organizations logo and specialize the colors and fonts in the presentation of data sets.
